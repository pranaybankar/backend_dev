## Some considerations
1. I have not give this project any identifiable name, so please do not judge me on that.
2. I have used SQLITE as DB for this project.
3. Using FastAPI and UVICRON for creating the RestFul APIs.
4. Used SqlAlchemy for ORM.

1. Clone this repository in you system using git clone `git clone git@github.com:pranaybankar/backend_dev.git`.
2. Make sure Docker is running on your laptop.
3. Go inside peoject and run this command `docker-compose up --build` to build this project. FastAPI will take some time to run the project.
